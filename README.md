<p align="center"> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/waveform-banner.jpg" height="180"> </p> <h2 align="center">🔊 Hear the City, Understand the World! 🔊</h2>
💡 Why This Project is AWESOME
Imagine: Your computer or phone listening to the city, instantly telling you what’s happening— from a child laughing to the siren of an approaching ambulance.

Built for Innovation: Turn “noise” into insights for smart cities, safety, accessibility, urban research, and beyond!

Highly Visual. Very Fun. Limitless Potential.

🎇 Features That Shine
🌆 Classifies 10 Iconic Urban Sounds:
Air conditioner, car horn, children playing, dog bark, drilling, engine idling, gun shot, jackhammer, siren, street music.

🎵 Studio-Grade Audio Features:
MFCCs extract the unique “fingerprint” of every sound.

🧠 Top-Notch Models:
Random Forest, Keras Deep Neural Networks, even ready for your custom innovations.

⚡ Mobile & Real-Time Ready:
Deploy on phone or Raspberry Pi and get instant sound alerts.

🚀 Google Colab & Jupyter Friendly:
Launch, run, and train — all in the cloud or on your laptop!

📦 Dataset: UrbanSound8K
An open dataset of 8,732 labeled urban sound clips across 10 categories.

Download: UrbanSound8K Official Dataset

Layout is optimized for fast experiments (by “folds” for cross-validation).

✨ How It Works (In 4 Stylish Steps)
📷 Step	📝 Description
1. Audio Processing	Each sound gets neatly sliced and “decoded” with MFCCs.
2. Model Training	The computer “listens” and learns what makes a dog bark unique from a jackhammer!
3. Prediction	Feed your own audio file—see its label INSTANTLY!
4. Real-Time	Use on-device microphones for live sound recognition & alerting!
